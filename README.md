# cscripts
My personal BASH scripts for running C files. Since I'm using this on a MAC I usually put my scrips in /usr/bin but use anything you put in your PATH. 

- cmain: Creates a C template with a stubbed out main and included standard libraries. 
- makerun: Runs a make on a single C file and runs the executable in one command.
